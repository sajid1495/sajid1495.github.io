# Portfolio Starter Template

This is a minimal HTML/CSS portfolio starter. It includes:

- `index.html` — homepage with hero section (photo + bio), About, Projects, Education, Contact.
- `css/styles.css` — simple responsive styles.
- `assets/profile.svg` — placeholder profile image.

How to preview

Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve it with a static server (e.g., `npx http-server`).

Customize

- Replace the image at `assets/profile.svg` with your photo.
- Edit text in `index.html` with your real bio, project links, education, and contact info.
- Add more pages or enhance with JavaScript as needed.

Next steps

- Add a contact form (with a server or a third-party provider).
- Add more project pages and a projects index.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages by enabling Pages in repository settings and pointing to `main` branch.
